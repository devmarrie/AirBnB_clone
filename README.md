### Flow
![full flow](https://github.com/devmarrie/AirBnB_clone/blob/master/images/flow.png?raw=true)

This project contains the following concepts as explained in the flow:
    A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
    A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
    A database or files that store data (data = objects)
    An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

### The Console
This involves creating a line interactive command session that enables you to easily manipulate your data using a shell like environment.The console is thus created using a cmd which is as base class and only requires to be subclassed and used as desired.
